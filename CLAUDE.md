# Project Agent Configuration

## MCP Tools Available
- `list_stories` — list all stories (supports filter by status/tag)
- `read_story` — read a story by ID or slug
- `create_story` — create a new story
- `update_story` — update story description/content
- `change_status` — change story status

## Custom Commands
- `/develop <id|slug>` — full development cycle for a story (implement + review)
- `/review <id|slug>` — run only the review agents on existing code

## Agent Roles (used internally by commands)

### Security Agent
Focuses on: hardcoded secrets, injection vectors, auth bypasses, insecure deps, sensitive data in logs.
Output format: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW findings with file:line references.

### Architecture Agent
Focuses on: God classes (>200 lines), circular deps, SOLID violations, business logic in wrong layer, naming inconsistency.
Output format: Must Fix / Should Fix / Nice to Have.

### Test Coverage Agent
Focuses on: untested public methods, happy-path-only tests, missing edge cases (null, empty, boundary), over-mocked tests, missing integration tests.
Output format: Untested Critical Paths / Weak Tests / Missing Edge Cases.

### Docs Agent
Focuses on: missing Javadoc/JSDoc on public API, undocumented REST endpoints, README gaps, non-obvious logic without comments, outdated comments.
Output format: Blocking / Important / Minor.

## Output Convention
Every agent MUST include a "Clean areas (no action needed):" section so humans know what was actually checked.

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Java / Spring Boot
- Frontend: SvelteKit
- DB: PostgreSQL
- Infra: Docker / Hetzner VPS

## Clean Code Conventions
All agents and implementation must follow these rules:

- **Names & size:** Intent-revealing names. Functions ≤20 lines, 0–2 args. Single responsibility. DI.
- **Error handling:** Exceptions not return codes. No null returns — use Optional/empty collections.
- **Design:** No side effects. Command-query separation. Law of Demeter (no chaining).
- **Abstraction:** DRY but don't over-abstract. Delete dead code. Prefer well-named methods over comments. No Javadoc on private methods.
- **Tests:** Arrange-Act-Assert. One concept per test. Same quality as production code.
- **Discipline:** Boy Scout Rule. Minimal design. Only extract when clearly needed.
